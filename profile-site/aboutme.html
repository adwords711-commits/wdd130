                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Jorge Gonzales Aguilar, and I am a dedicated professional with a strong background in business management, marketing, and database administration. The purpose of my website is to showcase my professional portfolio in a way that reflects both my technical skills and business experience. My goal is to provide a clear picture of who I am, what I have accomplished, and how my abilities can contribute to the success of an organization.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I have developed a unique combination of analytical, strategic, and technical skills. My background in business management has allowed me to gain experience in areas such as financial operations, team leadership, and organizational planning. I enjoy analyzing business performance, identifying areas for improvement, and applying data-driven solutions to achieve measurable results.</p>
                <p>In addition to management, I have a growing passion for marketing and data technology. I have worked on marketing strategies designed to strengthen brand identity and improve customer engagement. Through my studies and professional experience, I have learned how to use data to support smarter business decisions. My technical training has given me the tools to manage databases, automate processes, and analyze information efficiently. These skills allow me to bridge the gap between business strategy and technology, something I consider one of my greatest strengths.</p>

                <h2>More About My Background</h2>
                <p>My professional background includes a strong focus on business management, leadership, and education. I studied Business Management at BYU–Idaho, where I gained hands-on experience with planning, financial operations, and organizational goals. My past work has allowed me to develop leadership skills, manage responsibilities effectively, and learn how to support both team and company success. These experiences have shaped my career direction and helped me build a solid understanding of business principles that guide the way I work.</p>           
                <p>My skills and projects reflect my interest in technology, data, and marketing. I enjoy using tools to organize information, study results, and solve real problems. Many of my projects involve working with data, creating simple systems, and improving processes. I have also worked on marketing ideas that help build a clear brand message and connect with customers. Through teamwork and different professional tasks, I have learned how to think creatively, plan strategically, and contribute in meaningful ways.</p>
                <p>For anyone visiting my website, I also provide my contact information and opportunities to connect. I welcome professional networking, job-related conversations, or collaboration on projects. My goal is to create a space where others can reach out easily and learn more about my work.</p>
                <p>As I continue improving this website, I want it to stay informative and useful for those in business, finance, and database fields. I hope my work shows my values: dedication, curiosity, and integrity. I enjoy learning and being part of environments that support growth and new ideas.</p>
